Project: 386-p1 Guessing Game using Lehmer's Random Number Generator

Description:
In this project we use the Lehmer's Algorithm to generate random numbers that the user has to guess.

If the user is successful the game generators a new random number or prompts them to enter zero if they wish to quit.

If they are unsucessful then the game askes them to guess again and tells them if they are getting close are further from the correct
random number.

To get further help such as executing the file see the file usage.txt or run the program with the command line prompt of -h and it will show you the file. 

All files needed to execute the program are in this zipped folder and should all be placed together in the same directory for proper functioning of the game. 

Thank you and hope you enjoy.
